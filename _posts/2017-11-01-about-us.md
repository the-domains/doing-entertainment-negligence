# About Us

**Our Mission:** We will be the first professional nonprofit studio that routinely develops high quality material, makes public the comprehensive media-financing information and gives away profits to charities.

**Our method:** Collaborate with other organizations that share our vision and stay true to our mission.

**Our reason:** We want to address the need for a lack of factual information in the entertainment industry. Plus, we love entertainment and want to make it better!

Doing Entertainment Negligence is a nonprofit professional studio based in Los Angeles. A social entrepreneurship service that represents the interests of \[aspiring\]independent producers and audiences. We seek to provide not only high quality content but be a key source for factual data and information, including, but not limited to financing. 

Doing Entertainment Negligence's mission is to provide an overview of pictures, picture finance, and negligently eliminate the mystique of media(Hollywood) to create a level playing field. We want to address the need for a lack of factual information in the entertainment industry. We want to balance the economic development between creators and distributors. Doing Entertainment Negligence wants to be the first to produce work for the sake of factual data, undertake annual studies of just exactly how many films obtain theatrical release or other distribution, compare, contrast, and then disseminate this factual information to all concerned interests(the public), including schools, media commissions, and media festivals, so that, the young people considering careers as film producers will have more than mere speculation on which to base that career decision. Our projects will entertain while being rooted to educate, empower, and encourage troubled youths, unemployed, and hopeless to produce for motion pictures and television markets. This includes: classes, resources, communities, and jobs; that support diversity and media for their neighborhoods and employees.
