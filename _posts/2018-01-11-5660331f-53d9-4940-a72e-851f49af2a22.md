Doing Entertainment Negligence NPO (DENTV) is currently a state nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles.

Our vision is to establish productions with live/work projects to qualify as affordable housing.

We'd also like break new ground and give away some profits to charity.

Our organization functions as a Producer developing professional programming to own the rights exclusively for an agreed upon charity for each program developed, and to hold fundraising events in order to provide awareness of the organization's mission and programs to be developed.

We want to balance the economic development between creators and distributors with knowledge.

Doing Entertainment Negligence wants to provide hands on experience to all concerned interests(the public), including schools, media commissions, and media festivals, so that, the young people considering careers as producers will have more than mere speculation on which to base that career decision. Our projects will entertain while being rooted to educate, empower, and give back with the connected charity. This includes but not limited to: workshops, resources, communities, and volunteer opportunities; that support diversity and media for their neighborhoods and employees.
