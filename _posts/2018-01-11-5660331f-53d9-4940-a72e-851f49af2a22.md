**Our Mission: **We create, develop, and preserve sustainable space for media artists and arts organizations in marginalized communities.

**Our method:** Collaborate with other organizations and professionals that stay true to our mission and use the tools of real estate development to create places where artists can live and work.

Doing Entertainment Negligence NPO is a nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles.

Our vision to break new ground and give away profits to charity is just one part about us. We're also a social entrepreneurship service that represents the interests of \[aspiring\] independent producers and audiences. We seek to provide not only high quality content but be a key source for factual data and information, including, but not limited to financing by documenting and sharing our development process.

Our organization functions as a Producer developing professional programming to own the rights exclusively for an agreed upon charity for each program developed, and to hold fundraising events in order to provide awareness of the organization's mission and programs to be developed.

We want to balance the economic development between creators and distributors with knowledge and make giving to charity as easy as watching TV.

Doing Entertainment Negligence wants to provide facts, statistics, comparisons, contrasts, and then disseminate this factual information to all concerned interests(the public), including schools, media commissions, and media festivals, so that, the young people considering careers as producers will have more than mere speculation on which to base that career decision. Our projects will entertain while being rooted to educate, empower, and give back with the connected charity. This includes but not limited to: workshops, resources, communities, and volunteer opportunities; that support diversity and media for their neighborhoods and employees.
