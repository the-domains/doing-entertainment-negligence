# About Us

We're a state non-profit, community-based media and education organization based in Los Angeles.

---

**Our Mission: **We create, develop, educate with and preserve sustainable space for media artists and arts organizations in marginalized communities. We want to create jobs and living spaces for these communities.

**Our method:** Collaborate with other organizations and professionals that stay true to our mission and use the tools of real estate development to create places where artists can live and work.

**Our reason:** We want to address the need for economic development and homelessness. Plus, we love entertainment and want to make it better!

Doing Entertainment Negligence NPO (DENTV) is currently a state nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles. Meaning, we're not Federally recognized yet. We welcome a good Fiscal Sponsor in the meantime.

Doing Entertainment Negligence wants to provide hands on experience to all concerned interests(the public), including schools, media commissions, and media festivals, so that, the young people considering careers as producers will have more than mere speculation on which to base that career decision. Our projects will entertain while being rooted to educate, empower, and give back with the connected charity. This includes but not limited to: workshops, resources, communities, and volunteer opportunities; that support diversity and media for their neighborhoods and employees.

Our ultimate vision is to expand our brand, multiple 20 ' units, and establish productions with live/work projects to qualify as affordable housing.

We'd also like break new ground and give away some profits to charity.

We want to balance the economic development between creators and distributors with knowledge.
